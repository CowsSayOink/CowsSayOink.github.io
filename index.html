<h1>About Myself:</h1>

<p>
    I am a physics student in my last year at McGill and enjoy the experimental/engineering side of it.
    I am currently working on my honours thesis in climate physics, where I investigate the boundary layer properties prior to a thunderstorm that took place
    on July 13 2023 in Montreal.

</p>


<h1>Interests/Hobbies</h1>

<p>
    Whenever I have the time and weather is nice, I enjoy outdoor rock climbing, hiking and biking!
    Photos of my climbing and hiking trips can be found here and here is a link to my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/64401486"> Strava</a>.
    I love puzzle games. My personal favorites include The Witness, Tametsi and I have recently discovered Craking The Cryptic.
    I also have a nice collection of fountain pens and enjoy writing letters!
</p>



<h1>Music</h1>

<p>
    I went to a music high-school (école secondaire Joseph-François Perrault) and ended up playing the flute every day between grade 8-11.
    Those were amazing years of my life and taught me how to appreciate classical music. To this day, it is still my most listened genre and
    I have a Spotify <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2RVL0Uf1T54AT2GPMJXKz0?si=ced7cba31d744fc6">playlist</a> I like to recommend to friends who also enjoy classical music :)

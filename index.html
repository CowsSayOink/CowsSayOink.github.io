<h1>About Myself:</h1>

<p>
    I am a physics student starting off a masters in applied physics at EPFL in Switzerland.
    I just finished my undergrad at McGill in physics and did my thesis in atmospheric sciences.
    Whenever I have the time and weather is nice, I enjoy outdoor rock climbing, hiking and biking!
    Photos of my outdoor trips can be found <a href="https://felixbelair.ca/photos.html"> here</a> and i try to log my bike rides on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/64401486"> Strava</a>.
    I love puzzle games. My personal favorites include The Witness, Tametsi and I have recently discovered Craking The Cryptic.
    I also have a nice collection of fountain pens and enjoy writing letters!
</p>



<h1>Music</h1>

<p>
    I went to a music high-school and ended up playing the flute every day between grade 8-11.
    Those were amazing years of my life and taught me how to appreciate classical music.
    To this day, it remains my most-listened-to genre, and I even have a Spotify <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2RVL0Uf1T54AT2GPMJXKz0?si=ced7cba31d744fc6">playlist</a> I like to recommend to friends who share the same passion :)
    I also have a second <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0DPoWTUkyCEA9JuGNdV1Wm?si=1f8fbf9635e24ed8">playlist</a> centered around relaxing slow movements.
    I often listen to it when studying or working on assignments.

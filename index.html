<h1>Félix Bélair</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my website!</p>



<h1>About Myself:</h1>

<p>
    I am a physics student in my last year at McGill and enjoy the experimental/engineering side of it.
    I am currently working on my honours thesis in climate physics, where I investigate the boundary layer properties prior to a thunderstorm that took place
    on July 13 2023 in Montreal.

</p>


<h1>Interests/Hobbies:</h1>

<p>
    Whenever I have the time and weather is nice, I enjoy outdoor rock climbing, hiking and biking!
    I love puzzle games. My personal favorites include The Witness, Tametsi and I have recently discovered Craking The Cryptic.
    I also have a nice collection of fountain pens and enjoy writing letters!
</p>

<-- We need a pen section. I use a Kaweco brass (eco brass with no lead) sport to write notes every day in class.
    The other pens see some love too as I try to write a few letters every month to friends and family. -->


<h1>Future Plans:</h1>

<p>
    I am planning on going to graduate school in the fall at either UBC, EPFL or TU Delft in applied physics, but
    I am also open to the possibility of going straight into R&D industry.

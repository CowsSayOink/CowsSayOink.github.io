    From left to right, we have:
    All the nibs are either fine or extra-fine, as my handwriting is quite compact.
    I wish I could write with other nib sizes and play with line variation and sheen, but it would drive me crazy having my e's and l's fill up.

<h2>
    Story behind the pens:
</h2>


<h3>
    Kaweco
</h3>

<p>
    I use a Kaweco brass (eco brass with no lead) sport to write down notes and for my assignments on a daily basis.
    I purchased the instrument right after my vector calculus midterm in my first year of undergrad. Since that day, it has never left me when I head down to campus.

<h3>
    Diplomat Aero
</h3>

<p>
    The story behind this one is quite lengthy... My 4th semester at McGill was quite hectic, due to weekly assignments for many of my courses. So after finals, I decided I would get something special.
    I wanted something that was different, so not the classic black cigar-shaped pen, and I ended up choosing the Pelikan M1000.

<h3>
    Pilot custom 823
</h3>

<p>
    This was the first high-end pen I got. It looks amazing and I had only heard great things about it, so when I saw it on discount on Pensachi, it was an immediate buy.
    It writes amazingly, and it is always fun to write letters with.

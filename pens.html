    Here is a photo of my pen collection:
</h1>


<div><img src = "images/pens.JPG" alt = "Pens!"/></div>

<p>
    From left to right, we have: Kaweco Brass sport, Lamy 2000, Edison G-10, Diplomat aero, Pilot Capless, Pilot Custom 823.
    All the nibs are either fine or extra-fine, as my handwriting is quite compact :)
    I wish I could write with other nib sizes and play with line variation and sheen, but it would drive me crazy having my e's and l's fill up.

<h2>
    Story behind some of the pens:
</h2>


<h3>
    Kaweco
</h3>

<p>
    I use a Kaweco brass (eco brass with no lead) sport to do assignments and to write down notes on a daily basis.
    I purchased the instrument right after my vector calculus midterm in my first semester of undergrad. Since that day, it has never left me when I head down to campus.
    A patina can be seen where I tend to hold the pen, indicating that the pen has been put to good use. Often filled with Noodler's heart of darkness.

</p>



<h3>
    Diplomat Aero
</h3>

<p>
    My 4th semester at McGill was quite hectic, due to weekly assignments for many of my courses. So after finals, I decided I would get something special.
    I wanted a pen that didn't have the classic black cigar look, and I ended up choosing the Pelikan M1000.
    It didn't write well out of the box, the nib kept on skipping since it was over-polished. The cap wiggled a tiny bit, but it had the best piston filling mechanism I had ever used.
    I ended up asking for a refund and got the aero. I often ink it up with purple ink :).
</p>


<h3>
    Pilot custom 823
</h3>

<p>
    This was the first high-end pen I got. It looks amazing and I had only heard great things about it, so when I saw it on discount on Pensachi, it was an immediate buy.
    It writes amazingly, and it is always fun to write letters with. I have used up an entire bottle of Iroshizuku Shin Kai with it, and now I'm using Robert Oster's fire and ice.
</p>





<h2>
    Paper!
</h2>

<div><img src = "images/paper.JPG" alt = "paper"/></div>

<p>
    In order to get an optimal writing experience, the fountain pen trinity of the nib, the ink and paper are main actors. A while back, I decided to find the best paper for my pens and found that the only decent store
    in Montreal (Nota Bene) didn't offer much of a selection. So when I visited my family in Toronto I decided that I would visit stationary stores there to see what I have been missing out... I had to stop after
    the second store since I had purchased enough paper to last me years. And so far my favorites are Yamamoto Cosmo Air Light, and Tomoe River. Yamamoto has great sheen and I love the texture.
    I also enjoy MD paper (not cotton) along with Rhodia.

    At some point, I obviously wanted a pen box and didn't find much online that pleased me, except for <a href = "https://goldspot.com/products/diplomat-wooden-desk-case-with-ink-wenge-1">this</a>.
    Except that I was being really cheap, so I obtained the physical dimensions of it and CADed my own version and printed it. If you want the files, here is a link to my <a href ="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5221928">thingyverse</a>
